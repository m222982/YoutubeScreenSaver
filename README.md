# YoutubeScreenSaver

## Purpose

YoutubeScreenSaver is a Windows screensaver application that transforms your screen into a dynamic display of your favorite YouTube videos when your computer is idle. Instead of a static image or animation, enjoy continuous playback of a YouTube video of your choice.

## Features

*   **YouTube Video Playback:** Plays any publicly accessible YouTube video as your screensaver.
*   **Configurable Video Link:** Easily set and change the YouTube video URL you want to display.
*   **Standard Windows Screensaver:** Integrates with the Windows screensaver system (`.scr` file).

## Installation

1.  Locate the `YoutubeScreenSaver.scr` file.
2.  Right-click on the `YoutubeScreenSaver.scr` file.
3.  Select the "Install" option from the context menu.
4.  This will register the screensaver with Windows.

## Configuration

Once installed, you can configure the YoutubeScreenSaver through the standard Windows Screen Saver Settings:

1.  **Open Screen Saver Settings:**
    *   **Windows 10/11:** Right-click on your desktop, select "Personalize", then go to "Lock screen", and click on "Screen saver settings".
    *   **Older Windows versions:** Right-click on your desktop, select "Personalize", and then click on "Screen Saver".
2.  **Select YoutubeScreenSaver:** In the Screen Saver Settings dialog, choose "YoutubeScreenSaver" from the dropdown list of screen savers.
3.  **Access Settings:** Click the "Settings..." button. This will open a configuration window.
4.  **Input Video Link:** In the configuration window, you will find a field to input or paste the YouTube video URL you wish to use. Enter the full URL of the video (e.g., `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=your_video_id`).
5.  **Save Changes:** Click "OK" or "Save" in the configuration window, and then "OK" in the Screen Saver Settings dialog to apply the changes.

Now, when your computer becomes idle, YoutubeScreenSaver will start playing the configured YouTube video.

## Important Note on Saving Settings

**Important Note on Saving Settings:** This screensaver saves its settings in a file (`youtubescreensaver.json`) located in the same directory as `YoutubeScreenSaver.scr`. If you want to be able to change and save settings, ensure `YoutubeScreenSaver.scr` is placed in a directory where your user account has write permissions. Avoid placing it directly in `C:\Windows\System32` if you intend to modify settings, as this directory is typically not writable by standard users.
